# Outlook-Link-to-Trello

A VBA module to create a bi-directional link between Outlook email items and Trello.

## Problem Statement
Official versions of "Outlook to Trello" integrations lack a very important feature: the ability to open the trigger email message in Outlook *from Trello*. This module adds that functionality, creating a static link between the email and the Trello card that enables the user to open Outlook mail items directly from Trello.
